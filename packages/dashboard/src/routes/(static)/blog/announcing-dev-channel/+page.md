I've decided to launch a dev channel for all things PocketBase/PocketHost. We'll be posting videos on how to use PocketBase, PocketHost, and other PocketBase related topics such as side projects, tutorials, and other ecosystem tools like PocketPages, PocketPress, and more.

Check out the channel, give it a like and sub [https://youtube.com/@pocketba5ed](https://youtube.com/@pocketba5ed)!
