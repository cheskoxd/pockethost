As [announced previously](/blog/hard-paywall), I've moved to a hard paywall. This means that every new user will have to pay for their PocketHost account before they can use it. There will be a 7 day free trial, but after that, you'll have to pay, and you will know that going in.

Freemium is broken, especially for small businesses. It's a great way to get people to try your product, but it's not a great way to grow independently.

I encourage everyone to consider subscribing to PocketHost. It's a great way to support the PocketBase community and ensure the project's long term viability.

Existing users will be grandfathered in.
